&emsp; I'm an engineer at [Mininglamp Academy of Sciences](http://mas.mininglamp.com/), [Mininglamp Technology](https://www.mininglamp.com/), Beijing. My research interests are in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Before that, I studied the realtionship and variation tendency of runoff and sediment transportation in the Yellow River, China.
